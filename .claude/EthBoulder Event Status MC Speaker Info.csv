Friday,11:05-11:30,Adam,Rene Pinnell,Artizen Fund,"René is the co-founder of Artizen, a platform built to fund breakthroughs in art, science, and technology by bringing wildly different kinds of creators into the same ecosystem. For the last twenty years, he’s worked across film, startups, and experimental tech—basically anywhere ideas collide and either die quickly or turn into something dangerous and interesting. Today, René is opening the Creativity Track with a talk about a simple but uncomfortable truth: ideas need sex. New ideas don’t come from staying in your lane or talking only to people who think like you. They come from collision, cross-pollination, and mixing with ideas from totally different intellectual, creative, and spiritual lineages. Most of the baby ideas that result will be weird, broken, or useless. A few will grow up to change the world.",Why ideas need to fuck ,NO ,tg message 2/5
